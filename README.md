- an order overview which highlights the customers selection
- an entry of the customers table number
- the total cost being displayed
- a submit order button to send the order to the kitchen

User Story:As a customer I want to be able to go from the Main Menu to the Customer Main / Order Screen, and from the Customer Menu / Order Screen to the Main Menu.

To implement this feature, we needed to:

To implement this feature, we needed to:
- Maintain our current Driver Class
